# SSD - Simple Service & Data Description

[[_TOC_]]

## About - What is SSD?

First and foremost it's supposed to be data format for describing data structures and services.
Additionally it provides tooling to work with the aforementioned format, which simplifies writing custom code generators.

## History - Why did I make this?

In one of the companies I was working we programmed in Delphi and we had a bunch of structs that needed to
be serialized. In order to serialize stuff in Delphi you need build the objects manually,
which was really error prone and annoying to work with. So I wrote a small (closed source)
code generator using [D](https://dlang.org/), [SDLang](https://sdlang.org/) and a template engine.

After a few months it was clear, that the template engine made certain things way harder to maintain and reason
about. Which is why I decided to rewrite the whole thing in C#. Thio time I used a custom parser to allow for more
streamlined data files and I built the generator in a way, that the actual code generation would be done through
C# DLLs. This way you could still use a template engine if you want by embedding it into a DLL and using that.

I was even allowed to open source everything except the custom code generation plugin we used internally.
The source code can be found here: https://github.com/hardliner66/codegenerator

I was still not really satisfied, as using the codegen in a cross platform way was still tricky and require mono.
After some time I was starting to use rust more and found out about webassembly,
which is what motivated me to start a third attempt. This time the goal was to allow plugins to be written in wasm,
to allow people to write their generators in whatever language they're comfortable with.

I called the project SSDCG first, which stood for **S**imple **S**ervice and **D**ata description format and **C**ode
**G**enerator. But the name was kinda hard to remember and the focus was always more on the unified data description
language, with the code generation being something that was the main use case for that language.

The project has already outgrown it's initial goal by supporting not only WASM,
but also Rhai (script language) and three different template engines, that can all work with the same unified data
model. Once your model is written, you can choose whatever technology fits your need the best to generate whatever
you want out from the model.

The data format also evolved quite a bit from the older versions and supports describing DataTypes, Enums, Imports,
Services with functions and events, as well as custom attributes on all of these to allow for even more customization.
It's modelled to be similar to a simplified rust, because I personally like the syntax quite a bit and it was a
natural choice, as the whole thing is written in rust itself as well.

## ATTENTION: BREAKING CHANGES!
As long as the crate version is below 1.0.0, breaking changes are to be expected.

Breaking changes so far:
| Version | Change                                                                                                                 |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0.8.0   | I changed the syntax from `handles` to `fn` and the field from `handlers` to `functions`                               |
| 0.9.0   | Rename crate to ssd                                                                                                    |
| 0.10.0  | Move AST to separate crate for use in wasm plugins                                                                     |
| 0.11.0  | Restrict places where comments can appear. This simplifies auto-formatting.                                            |
| 0.12.0  | Rename SsdcFile to SsdFile so it matches the project name                                                              |
| 0.13.0  | Doc-Comments are now officially part of the exposed data.                                                              |
| 0.14.0  | Remove liquid templates to simplify the code and remove code duplication. Tera seems close enough anyway.              |
| 0.15.0  | Put Ron behind a feature gate, as I already had some problems with it before and provide rsn (similar format) instead. |

## Features
* [x] Custom description language (basics are done, but some things are still missing)
* [x] Auto format
* Script Languages
   * [x] [Rhai](https://rhai.rs/)
* Template Engines
   * [x] [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)
   * [x] [Tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/)
* [x] Wasm (through [extism](https://extism.org/))
* [x] Data Export for use with other tools (JSON, Yaml, Toml)
* [x] Use raw data (JSON, Yaml, Toml, Rsn) instead of predefined ssd format
   * This allows the same tool to be used, even when working with data from somewhere else
* [ ] Basic sanity checks

### Cargo Features
- `default` is `wasm`, `tera`, `handlebars`
- `tera` enables support for tera templates
- `handlebars` enables support for handlebars templates
- `wasm` enables support for wasm plugins
- `ron` enables support for `ron`
- `all` enables everything

## Data Specification
It's mostly "what you see is what you get", as seen here:
- [data/test.svc](./data/test.svc) to see what the description language looks like.

Only restriction for now, is that auto-format will always put comments before the element right after. This means the following
```
data Test {
    a: i32, /// test
    b: i32,
}
```

will get formatted to:
```
data Test {
    a: i32,
    /// test
    b: i32,
}
```

## Test it out

To test it out, install the command, clone the repository and use the following command:
```rust
ssd generate rhai generators/cpp-like.rhai data/test.svc
```
